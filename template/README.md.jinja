## Usage

This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/) as package manager. You need to have it installed in your system.

Once you have that, you can run:

```bash
uv run poe sync
```

to create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies, including the development ones.

You also need to install the pre-commit hooks with:

```bash
uv run poe install-hooks
```

### Formatting, Linting and Testing

Format your code:

```bash
uv run poe format
```

Lint your code:

```bash
uv run poe lint
```

Static checks:

```bash
uv run poe check
```

Test your code:

```bash
uv run poe test
```

Do all of the above:

```bash
uv run poe flc  # Format, Lint and Check
uv run poe flct # Format, Lint, Check and Test
```
{% if include_docker %}
