# Development Workflow

## Package Management
- Use `uv` for all dependency management and Python environment operations
- Never use `pip` directly; always use `uv` commands
- Sync dependencies: `uv sync --all-extras`

## Task Runner
- Use `poe` (poethepoet) for running project tasks
- All poe tasks are defined in `scripts/app.toml`
- Run tasks with: `uv run poe <task-name>`

## Available Commands

### Dependency Management
```bash
uv run poe sync           # Sync all dependencies
uv run poe install-hooks  # Install pre-commit hooks
```

### Code Quality
```bash
uv run poe format         # Format code with ruff
uv run poe lint           # Lint and auto-fix with ruff
uv run poe check          # Run type checker (mypy)
uv run poe test           # Run tests with pytest
```

### Combined Workflows
```bash
uv run poe flc            # Format → Lint → Check (recommended before commits)
uv run poe flct           # Format → Lint → Check → Test (full validation)
```

## Code Quality Tools

### Ruff
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Auto-fix enabled by default
- Comprehensive linting ruleset (`select = ["ALL"]`)
- Specific ignores: ANN (type hints), D (docstrings), COM812, ISC001

### MyPy
- Strict mode enabled
- Handles all type checking (not ruff)

### Pytest
- Code coverage enabled by default
- Reports show missing coverage
- Fails if tests don't cover changes

## Workflow Best Practices
- Run `uv run poe flc` before committing changes
- Run `uv run poe flct` for complete validation
- Use pre-commit hooks for automated checks
- Address linter errors immediately (don't ignore or suppress)
